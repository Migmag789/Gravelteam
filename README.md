# Migmodpacks
Welcome to the Mig Modpacks !
Here, you can post issues, check the scripts files, the changelog of the modpacks... Everything you (probably) need !

Note for changelog files :
I, sometimes, try to update them in-time but I don't do it always. Maybe there will be a few things missing or nothing at all. When I do too big updates that takes a lot of time to develop, I forget to put many things or even everything, as all the mods I updated. What I mean is knowing X mod I updated from X update to X update is really hard when I don't really check, and I don't think that is too much useful. As I said, I try. Thanks for understanding !
